COVID-19 self-assessment test
Overview
The coronavirus outbreak has infected over 18 lac people around the world and, doctors,
healthcare professionals, medical staff and researchers in the scientific community at the
frontline of the pandemic have gone above and beyond the line of duty to provide care for
patients. The goal is to develop an online COVID-19 self-assessment test that anyone can
take if they are concerned they might have COVID-19. Alongside the website and potentially
more important. You will be able to find “state-based information, safety and prevention
tips, and search trends related to COVID-19, and further resources for individuals, educators
and businesses.
Background
A COVID-19 self-assessment system has several components. Through this system we can
save our time and fast prioritizing amongst patients and save lives that might have COVID19. COVID-19 systems allow to user to self-assessment test. After the self-assessment, the
system displays the probability high or low as (45.25 or 75.25) those cross more than 50%
result in its high then he/she will be treated on high priority. This act can save lots of lives,
time and money. We will set our test system parameters as per the recommendation of the
health specialist and well experience doctors to find exact true figure out the result. We can
be deployed systems in hospitals. It also helps among large scales patients.
The Idea
• The idea is to stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the
cases quickly.
• Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19.
• A machine learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a
person having the infection.
• The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited
testing capacity.
• The same model can be used to find potential candidates for conducting random
tests.
